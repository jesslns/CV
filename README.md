I enjoy the process of finding a solution to a problem and creating something innovative in itself. I have a strong analytical background from my master in Hydrology and as an environmental consultant for 2 years. I can work well under pressure and have good time management to meet deadlines. I also have extensive experience in working with internal and external clients to formulate solutions. My passion and curiosity about code leads me to become a full stack developer. I am selected as a Fellow student at Makers Academy where I am trained to work in a modern software development team.

## Skills

####  Problem Solving and algorithmic
- Able to formulate solutions step by step and solve problems in a logical and systematic fashion. 
- Can apply algorithmic and statistical skills in writing numerical models with Matlab and Python to investigate scientific problems and to perform time series analysis/forecasting.

#### Analytical
- Performed data processing to develop environmental strategies in urban planning projects.
- Performed flood risk analysis and wrote technical reports.

#### Adaptability and flexibility
- A fast and keen learner who take on board new idea and concepts quickly.
- Constantly exposed to different engineering software packages, which I can master within short time. 
- Learn coding using different resources.

#### Collaboration
- Pair programming daily during the software engineering course. 
- Collaborated with various departments to develop multi-disciplinary strategies for sustainable urban development. 
- Have good communication skills and remain open-minded, which can facilitate innovation in a collaborative envionment.

## Projects
|Project|Summary|Time frame|Technology|
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|Acebook<br> [(back-end API)](https://github.com/ellieturno/acebook-team-byteme)<br>[(front-end with REACT)](https://github.com/ellieturno/bytebook-frontend)|A facebook clone that was developed using Agile methodology. I was heavily involved in devloping the backend API, which is RESTful and adpopted the MVC pattern. Throughout the project our team has practiced Agile processes. We agreed on adopting 2-day sprints, we held daily standups at 10 am, and agreed on the development pipeline. I have implemented a lot of new tecchnologies in this projecct, which demonstrated that I am a fast learner. The new technologies that I have acquired include:<br> <li> Building the API with Node.js and Express framework,</li> <li> Use of NoSQL (MongoDB),</li><li> Use of Mongoose ORM to interact with the database,</li> <li> Hashing and salting user password with bcrypt in Node.js,</li><li>Use of Jason Web Token to authenticate user.</li> |2 weeks|Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, REACT|
|[Chitter](https://chitter-jl.herokuapp.com/#peeps)<br>([Github](https://github.com/jesslns/frontend-api-challenge))| A Twitter clone application. Developed a single-page app with front end interactive page using Vanilla JavaScript to communicate with the backend API. The goal of this project is to practice AJAX.| Weekend|JavaScript, JQuery|
|[Bowling Challenge](https://jesslns.github.io/bowling-challenge.github.io/)<br>([Github](https://github.com/jesslns/bowling-challenge.github.io))| My first JavaScript project: develop a bowling scorecard that count and sum the scores of a bowling game. The back-end logic was written with JavaScript and the interactive interface was created with jQuery. The goal of this project is to practice the prototype pattern in JavaScript.|2 weekends|JavaScript, jQuery<br>Testing: Jasmine|
|[Makers_BnB](https://github.com/jesslns/Makers_BnB)| An AirBnB clone, i.e. a database-backed web app that is RESTful and allow CRUD operations. The goal of the project is to practice Agile as a team: daily standups, agreeing on our MVP, utilised both pair and mob programming, discussion of business logic, and data architect, use git for collaboration.| 1 week| Active Record, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby<br>Testing: Rspec|
|[Rock Paper Scissors](https://rpsbyjess.herokuapp.com/)<br>([Github](https://github.com/jesslns/rps-challenge))| My first project on building a web app using the Model View Control approach. The goals of this project are to gained better understanding of the web ecosystem as well as reinforced my skills in writing clean code through encapsulation and delegation. I also became aware of single responsibility principle. |Weekend |HTML/CSS, Rack, Ruby Sinatra, Selenium-Webdriver <br>Testing: Rspec, Capybara|
|[Takeaway](https://github.com/jesslns/takeaway-challenge)|My first experience in implementing an API. The app allows user to order dishes and checkout. With the use of twillio gem and the twillio API, customer could receive a confirmation sms when a takeaway order was received. The goal of this project is to practice delegation to produce clean and readable code.|Weekend|Ruby, Twillio API<br>Testing:Rspec|
