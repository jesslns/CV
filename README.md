I enjoy the process of finding a solution to a problem and creating something innovative in itself. I have a strong analytical background from my master in Hydrology and as an environmental consultant for 2 years. I can work well under pressure and have good time management to meet deadlines. I also have extensive experience in working with internal and external clients to formulate solutions. My passion and curiosity about code leads me to become a full stack developer. I am selected as a Fellow student at Makers Academy where I am trained to work in a modern software development team.

## Skills

####  Problem Solving and algorithmic
- Able to formulate solutions step by step and solve problems in a logical and systematic fashion. 
- Can apply algorithmic and statistical skills in writing numerical models with Matlab and Python to investigate scientific problems and to perform time series analysis/forecasting.

#### Analytical
- Performed data processing to develop environmental strategies in urban planning projects.
- Performed flood risk analysis and wrote technical reports.

#### Adaptability and flexibility
- A fast and keen learner who take on board new idea and concepts quickly.
- Constantly exposed to different engineering software packages, which I can master within short time. 
- Learn coding using different resources.

#### Collaboration
- Pair programming daily during the software engineering course. 
- Collaborated with various departments to develop multi-disciplinary strategies for sustainable urban development. 
- Have good communication skills and remain open-minded, which can facilitate innovation in a collaborative envionment.

## Projects
|Project|Summary|Time frame|Technology|
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|AsanaApp<br>([Github](https://github.com/nomats/asanaApp))|A yoga pose app that can check if the user has the correct pose. <br> The app can capture a user's pose through a webcam and send data to PoseNet(a machine learning model that allows for real-time human pose estimation). PoseNet then returns spatial data from 17 pose key points. Those data will be processed by a model that we implemented and check if relationship between keypoints can fulfill the criteria for a certain yoga pose. Key experience:<br><li>Setting up deployment pipeline with Travis CI for quality assurance</li><li>Handling and processing real-time geospatial data</li>|2 weeks|JavaScript, REACT, PoseNet API,<br>Testing with Jest|
|Acebook<br> [(back-end API)](https://github.com/ellieturno/acebook-team-byteme)<br>[(front-end with REACT)](https://github.com/ellieturno/bytebook-frontend)|A facebook clone that was developed using Agile methodology. I was heavily involved in devloping the backend API, which is RESTful and adpopted the MVC pattern. Our team learnt collaborately when applying new technologies, which include:<br> <li> Building the API with Node.js and Express framework,</li> <li> Use of NoSQL (MongoDB),</li><li> Use of Mongoose ORM to interact with the database,</li> <li> Hashing and salting user password with bcrypt in Node.js,</li><li>Use of Jason Web Token to authenticate user.</li> |2 weeks|Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, REACT|
|[Chitter](https://chitter-jl.herokuapp.com/#peeps)<br>([Github](https://github.com/jesslns/frontend-api-challenge))| A Twitter clone application. Developed a single-page app with front end interactive page using Vanilla JavaScript to communicate with the backend API. The goal of this project is to practice AJAX.| Weekend|JavaScript, JQuery|
|[Bowling Challenge](https://jesslns.github.io/bowling-challenge.github.io/)<br>([Github](https://github.com/jesslns/bowling-challenge.github.io))| My first JavaScript project: develop a bowling scorecard that count and sum the scores of a bowling game. The back-end logic was written with JavaScript and the interactive interface was created with jQuery. The goal of this project is to practice the prototype pattern in JavaScript.|2 weekends|JavaScript, jQuery<br>Testing: Jasmine|
|[Makers_BnB](https://github.com/jesslns/Makers_BnB)| An AirBnB clone, i.e. a database-backed web app that is RESTful and allow CRUD operations. The goal of the project is to practice Agile as a team: daily standups, agreeing on our MVP, utilised both pair and mob programming, discussion of business logic, and data architect, use git for collaboration.| 1 week| Active Record, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby<br>Testing: Rspec|
|[Takeaway](https://github.com/jesslns/takeaway-challenge)|My first experience in implementing an API. The app allows user to order dishes and checkout. With the use of twillio gem and the twillio API, customer could receive a confirmation sms when a takeaway order was received. The goal of this project is to practice delegation to produce clean and readable code.|Weekend|Ruby, Twillio API<br>Testing:Rspec|
