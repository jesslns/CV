## Jessica Ngai Sui Leung

A former water engineer who aspires to be a full stack developer and is enrolled in London's leading software development bootcamp. I have participated in a range of master planning projects as a team and performed data analysis individually. As a water engineer, I have enjoyed formulating environmental strategies, but the use of modelling packages do not give me the same sense of satisfaction if I were the person who develop the programme. 

Upon completing Makers Academy bootcamp, I will be equipped with software engineering skills that can combine with my creativity in developing solutions to tricky problems.

## Skills

#### Analytical and Problem Solving

I wrote numerical models with Matlab and Python regularly to solve scientific problems during my university studies. My job as an environmental consultant required data processing and formulating water resources management strategies for urban planning projects. I am trained to formulate solutions step by step, wchich allows me to solve any problems in a logical fashion.

#### Adaptability

I have demonstrated good adaptability through various volunteering work and multi-disciplinary projects.
As an environmental consultant I worked with various departments to formulate inter-disciplinary strategies to achieve sustainable urban development. A few strategies are often required to adapt to clients' requirement.

- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Researching Skills

Investigaed site constraints in order to provide site-spcific strategies and research for innovative solutions. Data collection at sites.

- Investigate different water quality checking techniques for rural village in Tanzania.
