## Jessica Ngai Sui Leung

A former water engineer who is enrolled in London's leading software development bootcamp. I have participated in a range of master planning projects as a team and performed data analysis individually. As a water engineer, I have enjoyed formulating environmental strategies, but the use of modelling packages do not give me the same sense of satisfaction if I were the person who develop the programme. 

Upon completing Makers Academy bootcamp, I will be equipped with software engineering skills that can combine with my creativity in developing solutions to tricky problems.
