## Jessica Ngai Sui Leung

A highly-motivated individual backed with strong analytical and problem solving skills aspires to be a full stack developer. During my study at university, I very much enjoyed writing numerical models to simulate various environmental processes. It is very rewarding to see complicated processes being solved in an organised and concise fashion. After graduation, I became an environmental consultant. My primary role was to develope water management strategies and perform flood risk analysis regularly. I enjoyed solving environmental problems and performing data analysis but the use of commercial software packages was not as satisfying as writing the programme.

While I was looking for an opportunity to steer my career towards programming within the field of civil engineering, my interest in software development was sparked by my friend, who showed me his side project: a climbing-related web app. Since then, I started learning coding on codecademy and learning the basics of web app development on coursera. After 2 months of self-teaching, I have decided to turn my hobby into a career and was enrolled in Makers Fellowship Programme -- London's leading software development bootcamp. Upon completing Makers Academy bootcamp, I will be equipped with software engineering skills that can combine with my creativity in developing solutions to tricky problems. 

## Skills


#### Analytical and Problem Solving

I wrote numerical models with Matlab and Python regularly to investigate scientific problems during my university studies. As an environmental consultant, I performed data processing to develop environmental strategies in urban planning projects and to undertake flood risk analysis. I am trained to formulate solutions step by step and solve problems in a logical and systematic fashion.

#### Algorithmic 

During my 4-year university studies, I regularly apply algorithmic and statiscial skills in writing numerical models to perform time series analysis and forcasting in the context of environmental engineering, such as:

- Hydroinformatics
- Groundwater flow and quality modelling
- Rainfall-runoff modelling

#### Adaptability and flexibility

I am a fast learner who take on board new idea and concepts quickly. During my 2-year consultancy experience, I am constantly exposed to different engineering software packages, whcih I can master within short time. When investigating best environmental practice management, site constraints were considered and alternative solutions were also included. 

#### Collaboration

I collaborated constantly with various departments to develop multi-disciplinary strategies for sustainable urban development as an environmental consultant. I have developed good communication skills and understand the importance of being ope-minded in an collaborative envionment to facilitate innovation.
