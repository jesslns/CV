## Jessica Ngai Sui Leung

A highly-motivated individual backed with strong analytical and problem solving skills aspires to be a full stack developer. During my study at university, I very much enjoyed writing numerical models to study various environmental processes as it is very rewarding to see complicated processes being solved in a quick and tidy fashion. After graduation, I became an environmental consultant. I participated in a range of master planning projects and perform flood risk analysis regularly. I enjoyed solving environmental problems and performing data analysis but the use of commercial software packages do not give me the same sense of satisfaction as I had in writing the code.

My interest in software development was sparked by my friend who showed me his side project: a climbing-related web app. Since then, I started learning coding on codecademy and learning the basics of web app development on coursera. After 2 months of self-teaching, I have decided to turn my hobby into a career and was enrolled in London's leading software development bootcamp. 

Upon completing Makers Academy bootcamp, I will be equipped with software engineering skills that can combine with my creativity in developing solutions to tricky problems. 

## Skills

#### Analytical and Problem Solving

I wrote numerical models with Matlab and Python regularly to solve scientific problems during my university studies. As an environmental consultant, I performed data processing to develop environmental strategies in urban planning projects and to undertake flood risk analysis. I am trained to formulate solutions step by step and solve problems in a logical fashion.

#### Adaptability

I am a fast learner who take on board new idea and concepts quickly. During my 2-year consultancy experience, I am constantly exposed to different engineering software packages, whcih I can master within short time. When investigating best environmental practice management, site constraints were considered and alternative solutions were also included. 

#### Collaboration

I collaborated constantly with various departments to develop multi-disciplinary strategies for sustainable urban development as an environmental consultant. I have developed good communication skills and understand the importance of being ope-minded in an collaborative envionment to facilitate innovation.
